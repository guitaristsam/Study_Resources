    Remove any extraneous language, focusing only on the critical aspects of the passage or topic.

    Strictly base your notes on the provided text, without adding any external information.

    Conclude your notes with [End of Notes, Message #X] to indicated completion, where “X” represents the total number of messages that I have sent. In other words, include a message counter where you start with #1 and add 1 to the message counter every time I send a message.

Predicting using PYQs   
```txt
Analyze the provided Previous Year Questions (PYQ) PDF to identify patterns in question repetition, topics of focus, and recurring concepts. Use advanced text analysis, trend detection, and probability estimation to determine the most likely
'as-it-is' questions that may appear this year. Provide a ranked list of the highest probability questions based on historical trends, weightage, and similarity in phrasing. Ensure the output is structured with:
Exact repeated questions from past years.
Slightly modified but conceptually similar questions.
Emerging trends based on recent shifts in question patterns
Give more importance to latest papers(all are labeled by year)


Sort by weightage per topic and then find weightage of numericals and theory per topic and subtopic.(make me a table)
